        <p>
            I am a new developer looking to get into front-end and cyber security. I completed a coding 
            boot-camp with Rutgers University that started at the end of February 2022 and passed the class at the end of the summer 
            on the same year. The bootcamp gave passing students a digital certificate to put on their Linkedin accounts that I will provide
            at the end of this section. Before starting the boot-camp I completed an associates in Crimal Justice with Passaic County
            Community College. I have work at a variety of different jobs over the years and I have learned different skills to 
            succeed at them. At the end I will also link my CV from my google drive.

            As mentioned before in "About Me" Im looking to start my coding career. While I am working I am also taking online 
            coding classes to refresh myself and learn more about what was lightly covered or not part the their syllabus. Below are 
            a handful of projects the bootcamp had me complete to get a passing grade. They are in no real order along with group 
            projects
